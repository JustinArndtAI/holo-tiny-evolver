# Fixes Applied to HKM Pipeline

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ CUDA Toolkit
**Issue**: CUDA toolkit not in system PATH
**Resolution**: Not needed - PyTorch includes its own CUDA runtime (12.1)
**Verification**: 
- CUDA is available: True
- GPU detected: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU
- Ready for GPU acceleration

### 2. ✅ Sympy Version Conflict
**Issue**: PyTorch requires sympy 1.13.1, but transformers had import errors
**Resolution**: Upgraded to sympy 1.14.0 - works with transformers despite pip warning
**Note**: The dependency warning from pip can be ignored - both packages work correctly

### 3. ✅ Model Downloads
**Issue**: Initial download script failed due to sympy and Unicode encoding
**Resolution**: 
- Fixed Unicode characters (✓ → [OK], ✗ → [ERROR])
- Successfully downloaded:
  - DistilBERT base uncased model (268MB)
  - Microsoft Phi-1.5 model (2.8GB)
- Both models tested and working

## Current Status
- ✅ GPU acceleration working
- ✅ All libraries functional
- ✅ Models downloaded and tested
- ✅ Environment ready for HKM implementation

## Test Commands
```bash
# Verify CUDA
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Test transformers
python -c "from transformers import AutoModel; print('Transformers OK')"

# Run model downloads
python scripts/download_models.py
```
