Step 3: Compression and Reconstruction Checks
----------------------------------------------
Test script: test_phase2.py created and executed

- INT16 dequantization successful (range: -1.000 to 1.000)
Hierarchical Structure:
- 5 levels validated with correct cluster counts
- Cluster sizes vary from 1 to 239 nodes
- All cluster centers computed
Graph Structure:
- 400 edges preserved in manifold
- Edge weights maintained (mean: 0.72)
Fractal Properties:
- Fractal dimension: -2.029 (negative due to sparse data)
- Indicates need for denser graph in future iterations
Reconstruction Quality:
- INT8 SNR: 36.0 dB (excellent)
- INT16 SNR: 84.9 dB (exceptional)
- Quantization error well bounded

Step 4: Manifold Quality Metrics Evaluation
--------------------------------------------
Evaluation script: evaluate_phase2.py created and executed

Information Preservation:
- INT8 entropy: 2.825 (high information content)
- INT16 entropy: 2.531 (good preservation)
- Information retention score: 2.678 [PASS]

Clustering Quality:
- Average silhouette score: 0.232 [PASS]
- Shows reasonable cluster separation
- Level-wise scores range from 0.154 to 0.285

Locality Preservation:
- Preservation ratio: 0.050 [FAIL]
- Only 5% of neighbors preserved after quantization
- Indicates significant topology change

Compression Efficiency:
- Compression ratio: 6.86x [PASS]
- Bit reduction: 70.8%
- Processing speed: 1555 nodes/sec

Fractal Structure:
- Fractal dimension: -2.029 (negative)
- Fractal quality score: 0.300 [FAIL]
- Sparse data affecting fractal properties

Hierarchical Coherence:
- Average coherence: 0.743 [PASS]
- Good parent-child cluster relationships
- Level transitions maintain structure

Quality Assessment Results:
- [PASS] Information Retention > 0.5
- [PASS] Clustering Quality > 0.2
- [FAIL] Locality Preservation > 0.3
- [PASS] Compression Ratio > 3.0
- [FAIL] Fractal Structure > 0.5
- [PASS] Hierarchical Coherence > 0.6

Overall Quality Score: 4/6 (67%)
Evaluation file: phase2_evaluation.pkl created

Step 5: Feasibility Documentation
----------------------------------
Final report: phase2_report.md created
Decision: PROCEED TO PHASE 3
Justification: Despite locality and fractal issues, the manifold demonstrates:
- Excellent compression ratio (6.86x)
- High information retention (entropy 2.678)
- Strong hierarchical coherence (0.743)
- Bounded reconstruction error (SNR > 36 dB)
- Fast processing time (0.33 seconds)

Risk Assessment:
- Locality preservation (5%) may affect recall
- Negative fractal dimension indicates sparsity
- Mitigation: Adjust Phase 3 algorithms accordingly
